// Tushar
console.log("Hey There!")

// 

/* 
=>console.log(window) 

you will get error because while 
embed v8 engine in node js every DOM 
related functionality removed 
(like queryselector,getElementById,window,alert etc..) 
because nodejs only can use for server side rendering purpose

=> only JS core functionality available in "nodejs" which is needed for serverside rendering
and also some fun. added too like hash,crypography like functionality
